#The .gitignore file in your dist folder tells Git to ignore all files in the dist folder, 
#which is useful because these files are generated by Webpack and typically do not need to be version-controlled.
#When you make changes to your project, you're usually modifying the source files, not the 
#generated files in the dist folder. After modifying the source files, you would then regenerate the dist files by 
#running your Webpack build command (usually npm run build or similar). 
#Then, you can commit your changes to the source files and push them to the main branch. 
#The generated dist files do not need to be committed or pushed.
#When you want to update your GitHub Pages site, you run the Webpack build command again to 
#regenerate the dist files, and then use git subtree push --prefix dist origin gh-pages to update 
#the gh-pages branch with the new dist files.
#In this way, your source files and your generated files are kept separate: your source files 
#are version-controlled on the main branch, and your generated files are served by GitHub Pages 
#from the gh-pages branch.
